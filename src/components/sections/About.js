      <h2>
        I just received a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from
        Colorado State University
      </h2>
      Colorado State University is located in Fort Collins, Colorado. That
      happens to also be my hometown!
      <h2>
        Now, I'm about to start my job as a software developer for Epic Systems.
      </h2>
      Epic is located in Verona, Wisconsin and develops healthcare software. I'm
      looking forward to the experience of a new town and a new job!
      <h2>
        Before I got my job at Epic, I was an IT Specialist/GIS Analyst intern at the USDA and Colorado State University.
      </h2>
      I built some impactful tools and interesting projects that you can (and should) read more about below.
